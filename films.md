## Mákĩra (202?)
The jungle is a cruel landscape dominated by a funereal silence, yet in its highly dynamic turns of life, its alien order which consumes everything, it attains a symphonic and majestic quality. While I finish editing the documentary, here are some <a href="darien2022">pictures of the production</a> and a <a href="https://youtu.be/o4ib0UvwCXk">rough snippet</a> of what it will look like. 

## [Sketch on the 28th of November in Nuevo Vigia](https://youtu.be/eLRUpVdjN0Q)
On the 28th of November, Panama celebrates its indepence from Spain with parades all over the country. The composition and horizontal movement makes me think of a <a href="https://art.thewalters.org/detail/33305/sarcophagus-with-the-triumph-of-dionysus/">relief</a> and the trumpeters in Mantegna's <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/andrea-mantegna-the-triumphs-of-caesar-1-the-trumpeters">"Triumphs of Caesar"</a>. While it gets too dark at some points, I like the image of a marching band walking through the night, only becoming visible under slits of light, as if they were figures in a carousel slide projector. Maybe I'll get to use similar techniques in a future project.
