I am a systems and low-level engineer with a B.A. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley. Check out my technical projects <a href="projects">here</a>.

I was born and raised in Panama, and have spent most of my formative years in the coasts of the Pacific and exploring the jungles of Colon.

History is the greatest stage, through my <a href="films">documentaries</a>, I aim to bring out the fiction within the endless currents of reality. 

I'm always looking for challenging and uncompromising creative endeavors, as well as energetic individuals to collaborate with.
