### C++, OpenCL, NumPy, PyTorch
Wrote <a href="https://github.com/isaaccastillod/bert-opencl">library</a> for core functions of BERT to test improvements for Vortex scheduler.

## PIPELINED RISC-V CPU ON FPGA
### Verilog and Xilinx Vivado
Designed, implemented, and ran a three-stage pipelined RISCV processor on a Xilinx
PYNQ-Z1 FPGA complete with forwarding that eliminates stalling from all data
hazards. In addition, the processor included an extension for Pointer Authentication
Codes.s

## MAPREDUCE
### Rust
Implementented fault tolerant programming model for scalable and highly
parallelized data processing based on the Google paper of the same name.

## END-TO-END ENCRYPTED FILE SHARING SYSTEM
## GOLang
Designed and implemented an end-to-end encrypted file-sharing system that
supports storing, loading, and efficiently modifying files, all in conjunction with
handling user permissions.
